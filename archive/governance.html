<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Prior to December 2022, Project Jupyter had a governance model based on a BDFL and a Steering Council, as described in this document.</p>

individuals and institutions in the roles defined in the governance

<section id="the-project">
<h2>The Project<a class="headerlink" href="#the-project" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The Jupyter/IPython Project (The Project) is an open source software project
affiliated with the 501c3 NumFOCUS Foundation. The goal of The Project is to
develop open source software and deploy open and public websites and services
for reproducible, exploratory and interactive computing. The Software developed
by The Project is released under the BSD (or similar) open source license,
developed openly and hosted in public GitHub repositories under the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ipython">IPython GitHub organization</a> and the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter">Jupyter GitHub organization</a>. Examples of
Project Software include the IPython Notebook, the IPython Terminal,
IPython.parallel, the Jupyter Hub, etc. The Services run by the
Project consist of public websites and web-services that are hosted
under the <a class="reference external" href="http://jupyter.org">jupyter.org</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org">ipython.org</a> domains. The Services Examples of
Project Services include the Jupyter and IPython websites
(<a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter.org">https://jupyter.org</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://ipython.org">https://ipython.org</a>), nbviewer
(<a class="reference external" href="https://nbviewer.ipython.org">https://nbviewer.ipython.org</a>) and the
Jupyter coLaboratory
(<a class="reference external" href="https://colaboratory.jupyter.org">https://colaboratory.jupyter.org</a>).</p>
<p>The Project is developed by a team of distributed developers, called
Contributors. Contributors are individuals who have contributed code,
documentation, designs or other work to one or more Project repositories.
Anyone can be a Contributor. Contributors can be affiliated with any legal
entity or none. Contributors participate in the project by submitting,
reviewing and discussing GitHub Pull Requests and Issues and participating in
open and public Project discussions on GitHub, Google+, Hackpad, Gitter chat
rooms and mailing lists. The foundation of Project participation is openness
and transparency.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the current Contributors to the main IPython repository:</p>
<p><a class="github reference external" href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/graphs/contributors">ipython/ipython</a></p>
<p>There are also many other Contributors listed in the logs of other repositories of
the Jupyter and IPython projects.</p>
<p>The Project Community consists of all Contributors and Users of the Project.
Contributors work on behalf of and are responsible to the larger Project
Community and we strive to keep the barrier between Contributors and Users as
low as possible.</p>
<p>The Project is formally affiliated with the 501c3 NumFOCUS Foundation
(<a class="reference external" href="https://numfocus.org">https://numfocus.org</a>), which serves as its fiscal
sponsor, may hold project trademarks and other intellectual property, helps
manage project donations and acts as a parent legal entity. NumFOCUS is the
only legal entity that has a formal relationship with the project (see
Institutional Partners section below).</p>

<section id="governance">
<h2>Governance<a class="headerlink" href="#governance" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This section describes the governance and leadership model of The Project.</p>
<p>The foundations of Project governance are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Openness &amp; Transparency</p></li>
<li><p>Active Contribution</p></li>
<li><p>Institutional Neutrality</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Traditionally, Project leadership was provided by a BDFL (Fernando Perez) and
subset of Contributors, called Core Developers, whose active and consistent
contributions have been recognized by their receiving “commit rights” to the
Project GitHub repositories. In general all Project decisions are made through
consensus among the Core Developers with input from the Community. The BDFL
can, but rarely chooses to, override the Core Developers and make a final
decision on a matter.</p>
<p>While this approach has served us well, as the Project grows and faces more
legal and financial decisions and interacts with other institutions, we see a
need for a more formal governance model. Moving forward The Project leadership
will consist of a BDFL and Steering Council. We view this governance model as
the formalization of what we are already doing, rather than a change in
direction.</p>

<p>The Project will have a BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life), who is currently
Fernando Perez. As Dictator, the BDFL has the authority to make all final
decisions for The Project. As Benevolent, the BDFL, in practice chooses to
defer that authority to the consensus of the community discussion channels and
the Steering Council (see below). It is expected, and in the past has been the
case, that the BDFL will only rarely assert his/her final authority. Because
rarely used, we refer to BDFL’s final authority as a “special” or “overriding”
vote. When it does occur, the BDFL override typically happens in situations
where there is a deadlock in the Steering Council or if the Steering Council
asks the BDFL to make a decision on a specific matter. To ensure the
benevolence of the BDFL, The Project encourages others to fork the project if
they disagree with the overall direction the BDFL is taking. The BDFL is chair
of the Steering Council (see below) and may delegate his/her authority on a
particular decision or set of decisions to any other Council member at his/her
discretion.</p>
<p>The BDFL can appoint his/her successor, but it is expected that the Steering
Council would be consulted on this decision. If the BDFL is unable to appoint a
successor, the Steering Council will make a suggestion or suggestions to the
Main NumFOCUS Board. While the Steering Council and Main NumFOCUS Board will
work together closely on the BDFL selection process, the Main NUMFOCUS Board
will make the final decision.</p>

<section id="steering-council">
<h3>Steering Council<a class="headerlink" href="#steering-council" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The Project will have a Steering Council that consists of Project Contributors
who have produced contributions that are substantial in quality and quantity,
and sustained over at least one year. The overall role of the Council is to
ensure, through working with the BDFL and taking input from the Community, the
long-term well-being of the project, both technically and as a community.</p>
<p>During the everyday project activities, council members participate in all
discussions, code review and other project activities as peers with all other
Contributors and the Community. In these everyday activities, Council Members
do not have any special power or privilege through their membership on the
Council. However, it is expected that because of the quality and quantity of
their contributions and their expert knowledge of the Project Software and
Services that Council Members will provide useful guidance, both technical and
in terms of project direction, to potentially less experienced contributors.</p>
<p>The Steering Council and its Members play a special role in certain situations.
In particular, the Council may:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make decisions about the overall scope, vision and direction of the
project.</p></li>
<li><p>Make decisions about strategic collaborations with other organizations or
individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Make decisions about specific technical issues, features, bugs and pull
requests. They are the primary mechanism of guiding the code review process
and merging pull requests.</p></li>
<li><p>Make decisions about the Services that are run by The Project and manage
those Services for the benefit of the Project and Community.</p></li>
<li><p>Make decisions when regular community discussion doesn’t produce consensus
on an issue in a reasonable time frame.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="council-membership">
<h4>Council membership<a class="headerlink" href="#council-membership" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>To become eligible for being a Steering Council Member an individual must be a
Project Contributor who has produced contributions that are substantial in
quality and quantity, and sustained over at least one year. Potential Council
Members are nominated by existing Council members and voted upon by the
existing Council. Based on a successful vote, the newly elected Member is
invited to serve in that capacity. The Council will be initially formed from
the set of existing Core Developers who, as of late 2014, have been
significantly active over the last year.</p>
<p>When considering potential Members, the Council will look at candidates with a
comprehensive view of their contributions. This will include but is not limited
to code, code review, infrastructure work, mailing list and chat participation,
community help/building, education and outreach, design work, etc. We are
deliberately not setting arbitrary quantitative metrics (like “100 commits in
this repo”) to avoid encouraging behavior that plays to the metrics rather than
the project’s overall well-being. We want to encourage a diverse array of
backgrounds, viewpoints and talents in our team, which is why we explicitly do
not define code as the sole metric on which council membership will be
evaluated.</p>
<p>If a Council member becomes inactive in the project for a period of one year,
they will be considered for removal from the Council. Before removal, inactive
Member will be approached by the BDFL to see if they plan on returning to
active participation. If not they will be removed immediately upon a Council
vote. If they plan on returning to active participation soon, they will be
given a grace period of one year. If they don’t return to active participation
within that time period they will be removed by vote of the Council without
further grace period. All former Council members can be considered for
membership again at any time in the future, like any other Project Contributor.
Retired Council members will be listed on the project website, acknowledging
the period during which they were active in the Council.</p>
<p>The Council reserves the right to eject current Members, other than the BDFL,
if they are deemed to be actively harmful to the project’s well-being, and
attempts at communication and conflict resolution have failed.</p>
</section>
<section id="conflict-of-interest">
<h4>Conflict of interest<a class="headerlink" href="#conflict-of-interest" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>It is expected that the BDFL and Council Members will be employed at a wide
range of companies, universities and non-profit organizations. Because of this,
it is possible that Members will have conflict of interests. Such conflict of
interests include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Financial interests, such as investments, employment, or contracting work,
outside of The Project that may influence their work on The Project.</p></li>
<li><p>Access to proprietary information of their employer that could potentially
leak into their work with the Project.</p></li>
<li><p>An issue where the person privately gains an advantage from The Project
resources, but The Project has no gain or suffers a disadvantage.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All members of the Council, BDFL included, shall disclose to the rest of the
Council any conflict of interest they may have. Members with a conflict of
interest in a particular issue may participate in Council discussions on that
issue, but must recuse themselves from voting on the issue. If the BDFL has
recused his/herself for a particular decision, they will appoint a substitute
BDFL for that decision.</p>
</section>
<section id="private-communications-of-the-council">
<h4>Private communications of the Council<a class="headerlink" href="#private-communications-of-the-council" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Unless specifically required, all Council discussions and activities will be
public and done in collaboration and discussion with the Project Contributors
and Community. The Council will have a private mailing list that will be used
sparingly and only when a specific matter requires privacy. When private
communications and decisions are needed, the Council will do its best to
summarize those to the Community after eliding personal/private/sensitive
information that should not be posted to the public internet.</p>
</section>
<section id="subcommittees">
<h4>Subcommittees<a class="headerlink" href="#subcommittees" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The Council can create subcommittees that provide leadership and guidance for
specific aspects of the project. Like the Council as a whole, subcommittees
should conduct their business in an open and public manner unless privacy is
specifically called for. Private subcommittee communications should happen on
the main private mailing list of the Council unless specifically called for.</p>
<p>Question: if the BDFL is not on a subcommittee, do they still have override
authority?</p>
<p>Suggestion: they do, but they should appoint a delegate who plays that role
most of the time, and explicit BDFL intervention is sought only if the
committee disagrees with that delegate’s decision and no resolution is possible
within the team. This is different from a BDFL delegate for a specific decision
(or a recusal situation), where the BDFL is literally giving up his/her
authority to someone else in full. It’s more like what Linus Torvalds uses with his
“lieutenants” model.</p>
</section>
<section id="numfocus-subcommittee">
<h4>NumFOCUS Subcommittee<a class="headerlink" href="#numfocus-subcommittee" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The Council will maintain one narrowly focused subcommittee to manage its
interactions with NumFOCUS.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The NumFOCUS Subcommittee is comprised of 5 persons who manage project
funding that comes through NumFOCUS. It is expected that these funds will
be spent in a manner that is consistent with the non-profit mission of
NumFOCUS and the direction of the Project as determined by the full
Council.</p></li>
<li><p>This Subcommittee shall NOT make decisions about the direction, scope or
technical direction of the Project.</p></li>
<li><p>This Subcommittee will have 5 members, 4 of whom will be current Council
Members and 1 of whom will be external to the Steering Council. No more
than 2 Subcommitee Members can report to one person through employment or
contracting work (including the reportee, i.e. the reportee + 1 is the
max). This avoids effective majorities resting on one person.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="institutional-partners-and-funding">
<h2>Institutional Partners and Funding<a class="headerlink" href="#institutional-partners-and-funding" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The BDFL and Steering Council are the primary leadership for the project. No
outside institution, individual or legal entity has the ability to own,
control, usurp or influence the project other than by participating in the
Project as Contributors and Council Members. However, because institutions are
the primary funding mechanism for the project, it is important to formally
acknowledge institutional participation in the project. These are Institutional
Partners.</p>
<p>An Institutional Contributor is any individual Project Contributor who
contributes to the project as part of their official duties at an Institutional
Partner. Likewise, an Institutional Council Member is any Project Steering
Council Member who contributes to the project as part of their official duties
at an Institutional Partner.</p>
<p>With these definitions, an Institutional Partner is any recognized legal entity
in the United States or elsewhere that employs at least one Institutional
Contributor or Institutional Council Member. Institutional Partners can be
for-profit or non-profit entities.</p>
<p>Institutions become eligible to become an Institutional Partner by
employing individuals who actively contribute to The Project as part
of their official duties. To state this another way, the only way for
an Institutional Partner to influence the project is by actively
contributing to the open development of the project, on equal terms
with any other member of the community of Contributors and Council
Members. Merely using Jupyter/IPython Software or Services in an
institutional context does not allow an entity to become an
Institutional Partner. Financial gifts do not enable an entity to
become an Institutional Partner. Once an institution becomes eligible
for Institutional Partnership, the Steering Council must nominate and
approve the Partnership.</p>
<p>If an existing Institutional Partner no longer has a contributing employee,
they will be given a one-year grace period for other employees to begin
contributing.</p>
<p>An Institutional Partner is free to pursue funding for their work on The
Project through any legal means. This could involve a non-profit organization
raising money from private foundations and donors or a for-profit company
building proprietary products and services that leverage Project Software and
Services. Funding acquired by Institutional Partners to work on The Project is
called Institutional Funding. However, no funding obtained by an Institutional
Partner can override The Project BDFL and Steering Council. If a Partner has
funding to do Jupyter/IPython work and the Council decides to not pursue that
work as a project, the Partner is free to pursue it on their own. However in
this situation, that part of the Partner’s work will not be under the
Jupyter/IPython umbrella and cannot use the Project trademarks in a way that
suggests a formal relationship.</p>
<p>To acknowledge institutional contributions, there are two level of Institutional
Partners, with associated benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> = an institution with at least one Institutional Council Member</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Acknowledged on the Jupyter/IPython websites, in talks and T-shirts.</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to acknowledge their own funding sources on the Jupyter/IPython
websites, in talks and T-shirts.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlimited participation in the annual Institutional Partners Workshop, held
during the (planned) annual Jupyter Project Retreat. This allows the
Institutional Partner to invite as many of their own employees and funding
sources and collaborators as they want, even if they are not project
Contributors or Council Members.</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to influence the project through the participation of their Council
Member.</p></li>
<li><p>Council Members are invited to the bi-annual Jupyter/IPython Developer Meeting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> = an institution with at least one Institutional Contributor</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Same benefits as Tier 1 level Partners, but:</p></li>
<li><p>Only Institutional Contributors are invited to the Institutional Partners
Workshop and bi-annual Jupyter/IPython Developer Meeting.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="changing-the-governance-documents">
<h2>Changing the Governance Documents<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-the-governance-documents" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Changes to the governance documents are submitted via a GitHub pull
request to The Project’s governance documents GitHub repository at
<a class="github reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter/governance">jupyter/governance</a>.
There are two phases to the process:</p>
<p><strong>The discussion phase</strong> begins when the person first opens a pull-request.
During this time, <em>the pull-request must be in a draft state</em>. The pull
request is refined in response to public comment and review, with the goal
being consensus in the community.</p>
<p>The pull request author may <em>call a vote</em> when they believe enough feedback
and iteration has occurred. This is triggered by moving the pull request from
the <em>draft state</em> to an <em>active state</em>. This triggers the voting phase.</p>
<p><strong>The voting phase</strong> begins when the PR enters an active state. The proposed
changes in the pull request are frozen, and may not be substantively modified
after voting has begun. During the voting phase, the Steering Council votes on
whether the changes are ratified and the pull request merged (accepting the
proposed changes) or that the pull request be closed without merging
(rejecting the proposed changes).</p>
<p>All votes are limited in time to 4 weeks after the voting phase begins. At the end of 4
weeks, the proposal passes if 2/3 of the votes are in favor (fractions of a
vote rounded up to the nearest integer); otherwise the proposal is rejected and
the PR is closed. Prior to the four-week limit, if at least 80% of the Steering Council
has voted and 2/3 of the votes are in favor (fractions of a vote rounded up to the nearest integer), the proposal passes. Since the BDFL holds ultimate
authority in The Project, the BDFL has authority to act alone in accepting or
rejecting changes or overriding Steering Council decisions.</p>
