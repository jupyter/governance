## Explanation of Project Jupyter copyright policy

Project Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains
copyright over their contributions to Project Jupyter. These contributions are
typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, Project Jupyter source code,
in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single person or institution.
Instead, Project Jupyter source code is the collective copyright of its
contributors. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes or contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change when they commit the
change to one of the Project Jupyter repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:

    # Copyright (c) Project Jupyter Contributors.
    # Distributed under the terms of the 3-Clause BSD License.
