# Project Jupyter Code of Conduct - Reporting Guide - Online Community

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report
it to Project Jupyter by emailing
[*conduct@jupyter.org*](mailto:conduct@jupyter.org) or by completing [this
form](https://goo.gl/forms/sJzOIie3zde9M71T2). All reports will be kept
confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need
to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all involved will remain
confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law
enforcement first. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate,
please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

If you choose to email instead of using the form, please include the following
information:

* Your contact info (not required, if you would like to remain anonymous please
  use the form)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
  were other witnesses besides you, try to include them as well
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a
  mailing list archive or GitHub/gitter.im) please include a link
* Any extra context you believe exists for the incident
* If you believe this incident is ongoing
* Any other information you believe we should have

*Note:* with anonymous reports, there are inherent limits in our ability to do
follow-up or collect additional information.  Hence we suggest that if you
would like to remain anonymous, you at least create a throw-away email address
without your real name.

## What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email from the Project Jupyter Code of Conduct Committee
acknowledging receipt immediately. We promise to acknowledge receipt within 24
hours (and will aim for much quicker than that).

The working group will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:
* What happened
* Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
* Who the individual(s) involved were
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's
  physical safety

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety,
the committee's immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This
means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation
has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

The Code of Conduct committee will then follow the
[standard procedure][enforcement.md#Resolutions] to arrive at and
communicate a resolution.


## Appealing the Code of Conduct Committee’s Response

To appeal a decision of the Code of Conduct Committee, contact the Jupyter
Steering Council at
[*steeringcouncil@jupyter.org*](mailto:steeringcouncil@jupyter.org) with your
appeal and they will review the case.

The Steering Council will gather all relevant information from the Committee
and provide a resolution within two weeks.  If more time is required, it should
inform the appellant within that time frame.
