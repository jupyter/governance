# Executive Council

## Purpose

The Executive Council (EC) is ultimately responsible for all dimensions of the Project (including, but not limited to, software, legal, financial, community, operations, inclusion and diversity, etc.). The members of the EC actively work to carry out the Project's mission in accordance with its values and to support operations through delegation to the Software Steering Council (SSC), Software Subprojects, Standing Committees, and Working Groups. These other bodies will report to the EC, and the EC is expected to support, oversee, manage, and ensure the success of operations across Jupyter.

## Responsibilities

### Sole responsibilities

The EC has the responsibility to:

- Establish, dissolve, support, and manage [Working Groups](standing_committees_and_working_groups.md#working-groups).
- Nominate particular Working Groups to have a representative on the SSC.
- Support and manage [Standing Committees](standing_committees_and_working_groups.md#standing-committees).
- Actively work to increase and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion across the Project and its leadership bodies.
- Maintain and implement the [Jupyter Code of Conduct](conduct/code_of_conduct.md) and incident response process.
- Serve as the body of appeal for incident decisions made by the Code of Conduct Standing Committee.
- Raise, allocate, and manage all Project funding and sponsorships, and set policies and procedures for third parties to request external funding with the official endorsement of Project Jupyter.
- Allocate resources, select candidates, define scope and priorities, and manage roles and personnel employed to conduct business operations on behalf of Project Jupyter.
- Manage legal aspects of the Project, such as copyright, contracts, compliance, and licensing.
- Manage the Jupyter brand, including the Project-wide website, core design philosophy, design assets, trademarks, and naming.
- Manage public communications and community activities, including social media, conferences, workshops, and community-wide resources.
- Manage any Jupyter services, including hosted services such as nbviewer, jupyter.org, and mybinder.org.
- Manage the Project’s relationship with NumFOCUS, its parent non-profit organization and fiscal sponsor.
- Write an annual stakeholders letter to provide a summary of the previous year’s activities across the community and to highlight the current and future direction of the Project.
- Mentor potential future EC members. The EC is expected to identify potential future members of the EC and proactively mentor those individuals.
- Maintain Project-wide documentation and information to enable users to discover and navigate the resources of the Project.

The EC can override decisions of the SSC, Software Subprojects, Standing Committees, and Working Groups in exceptional situations as the Project’s final decision-maker. The EC cannot override SSC decisions that are shared responsibilities, as listed below.

### Shared responsibilities with the Software Steering Council

The EC and SSC share responsibility for approving:

- Changes to the Jupyter Governance model.
- Creation of new Jupyter Subprojects.
- Removal of Subprojects from Jupyter.

In these decisions, each body will [vote](decision_making.md) independently and the change will be approved only if both bodies approve.

## Council membership and elections

The EC will consist of 6 Council members who serve 2-year terms. Members are elected from the body of the union of all Standing Committee, Working Group, and Subproject Councils ("Union of Councils", UoC). Any UoC member is eligible for candidacy in an election unless, as of the start of the new term, they have served on the EC for three or more of the last four years.

Each annual election will begin with the existing EC notifying the UoC of a call for nominations. Any member of the UoC may nominate a candidate, including themselves. The EC will confirm that a nominee accepts their nomination. The candidate shall write a statement of their interest, qualifications, experience, etc. that will be distributed to voters. Once the full set of candidates is assembled, the UoC and then the EC will take ranked choice votes to fill their allocated number of EC seats. After each election, the total number of seats filled by the UoC should be equal to, or one more than, the number filled by the EC.

If a member leaves the council before the end of their term, the EC may designate an eligible replacement who will serve for the rest of the term. This replacement will count as a seat filled by the EC if the replacement serves more than half of the term.

A person may not serve simultaneously on the EC and SSC.

The EC may vote to remove an EC member. A removal motion passes if two-thirds of the entire EC votes in favor of removal. All EC members are expected to vote without recusal, including the member in question.
