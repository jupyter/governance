# Checklist / Overview of Process

Here are some topics to consider during that conversation [pending link-content not available yet].

- [ ] Create charter (see template)
- [ ] Submit charter for review in the governance repo under the charter directory.

  - [ ] Once the review is addressed and the final draft is ready, take the pull request out of draft and update the description to include a deadline
  - [ ] See [voting template](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/pull/185) to simplify logistics of calling for a vote.
- [ ] Recruit additional members for committee (ideally between 4 - 8 total)
