<h1>Executive Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#executive-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>The Jupyter Executive Council (EC) has the responsibility to ensure the
healthy and sustainable evolution of Project Jupyter and to seek the
best vehicles to support this. <strong>We, the EC, propose to create a new
funding vehicle for the project, paired with some management and
operational changes in support of this funding mechanism, in partnership
with the Linux Foundation (LF)</strong>. These changes will enable us to grow
and develop ambitious efforts we have often discussed but lacked
resources to implement, and provide long-term stability both for key
Jupyter contributors and the project itself. While Project Jupyter has
been impactful and successful in many areas, we currently struggle in
our ability to scale in certain strategic directions and in maintaining
core functions needed for an effort of our size and scope. We believe
the plan below is the right path forward to meet these challenges;
we’ve come to this plan after a detailed exploration of multiple
options.</p>
<p><strong>We propose that Project Jupyter – with its current governance
structure, name, and trademarks – transfer from NumFOCUS to the Linux Foundation
Charities 501(c)(3). This transition would be paired with the creation
of a new resource, provisionally called the <em>Jupyter Foundation</em>,
designated to secure corporate contributions, and an associated
<em>committee</em> to make budgetary decisions associated with these funds. The
Jupyter Foundation would be under the Linux Foundation 501(c)(6).</strong>
Below, we provide more details about this proposal and answer questions.
This document aims to be a reference point for the community to discuss
this plan, which (after suitable community deliberation, refinement, and
approval) the EC would like to implement as soon as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Note –</strong> A 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(6) are both tax-exempt nonprofit
structures in the United States. A (c)(3) is a vehicle to support
collective fundraising for a scientific or charitable purpose. A
(c)(6) is a vehicle to support collective fundraising for a common
business interest in industry. Like many projects that the LF hosts,
Project Jupyter aligns both with nonprofit models with scientific and
educational goals, and with business interests. Therefore, it can take
advantage of having both fundraising options available to donors
through LF Charities, a 501(c)(3), and the Linux Foundation, a
501(c)(6).</p>

<h1>Project Jupyter’s Needs<a class="headerlink" href="#project-jupyter-s-needs" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Project Jupyter requires <strong>sustainable funding that is centrally managed
for some key “backbone needs” of the project.</strong> There are activities
and programs that are critical to the mission of Jupyter that are
currently either underfunded or unfunded. Examples include JupyterCon,
other Jupyter community and outreach events, Binder, NbViewer,
<a class="reference external" href="http://jupyter.org">jupyter.org</a>, an Executive Director, other project-wide staff (release
engineering, developer advocate, documentation writer, program manager,
testing infrastructure, etc.), and more. We believe that if a few such
“backbone” roles and activities are sustainably funded, it will become
easier for individual subprojects and teams in the community to pursue
strategic objectives, propose new developments, and seek targeted
resources that rely on this stable foundation for coordination,
planning, and project-wide interactions. <strong>The EC has a goal to raise
$1-2 million/year in a sustainable manner</strong>.</p>
<p><em>The EC believes that this funding can come from a combination of
non-profit (private foundations, government grants) and for-profit
(corporate) sources</em>. In the past, Jupyter has obtained grants on the
order of a million dollars and above through private foundations, with
smaller contributions coming from individuals and a few generous
corporate partners. Securing consistent funding via grants has proven
challenging given the lumpy nature of grant allocations and the limited
number of people who can devote their time to grant writing for Jupyter.
These inconsistent levels of funding make it very difficult to maintain
a stable backbone for the project that enables long-term vision and
strategic planning and execution. Similarly, we have faced challenges in
raising consistent funding from corporations.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jupyter needs <strong>improved operational support</strong>. Jupyter
needs a higher level of support for operating (legal/trademark,
marketing, fundraising, accounting, contracts, internships, events, dev
ops, etc.) than is currently available from NumFOCUS. The EC’s
responsibility is to serve Jupyter’s pressing needs today and tomorrow;
currently, the EC is spending a significant amount of its time on
operational matters instead of fundraising and other activities that
support Jupyter’s long-term mission. At this time, and after extensive
conversations with NumFOCUS and time spent by Ana Ruvalcaba taking deep
dives into operational matters, the EC’s assessment is that the best
course of action is to secure operational support with a proven partner
that can provide it today. <em>Our assessment is that the Linux Foundation
is such an ideal partner for Jupyter today</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, Jupyter needs to be able to hire and manage <strong>full-time
staff</strong>, including roles such as an Executive Director, CI/devops,
program managers, test engineering, documentation writing, and release
engineering. These require a sustained and full-time effort, beyond what
is reasonable for volunteers or can be funded via project-specific
initiatives and/or grants. In the past, we have funded, hired, and
managed these types of roles through universities (Cal Poly State
University, San Luis Obispo and UC Berkeley), but that is not
sustainable for the institution or the staff who seek a long term career
path associated with Jupyter, rather than with specific corporate or
academic organizations. Again, Jupyter needs sustainable funding and
operational support to hire, retain, and manage contributors in these
types of roles.</p>

<section class="tex2jax_ignore mathjax_ignore" id="so-what-would-be-changing">
<h1>So, what would be changing?<a class="headerlink" href="#so-what-would-be-changing" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>We have spent time and effort in discussions with the Linux Foundation
team, to ensure that this transition introduces the smallest possible
changes to Jupyter’s operations while meeting our above goals.</p>
<p>Under this proposal, <strong>Jupyter keeps its current governance structure
and transfers from NumFOCUS to LF Charities 501(c)(3). An additional
funding vehicle will be created called the Jupyter Foundation under the
Linux Foundation 501(c)(6) providing corporations a well-known and
proven method to support the Jupyter Project.</strong></p>
<p>In order to manage this new resource (the Jupyter Foundation), we
propose to create a new committee (JFC), populated by representatives of
our corporate funders. The role of this committee will be to approve the
use of the corporate funding available, in coordination with the EC. The
JFC and EC members will vote on Jupyter Foundation resource allocation
with exact details to be determined soon (for example, the funding
committee model typically has one vote per corporate funding
representative).</p>
<p>As part of the normal course of business, and to encourage strategic
engagement of the corporate partners (beyond just giving money), the EC
meetings will be open to members of the JFC, though the EC reserves the
right to call a separate closed meeting should the need arise.</p>
<p>In addition, the Linux Foundation through its 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(6)
will provide back-office operational support as needed for the project
operations such as grants and events as well as the ability to hire
staff for the benefit of the project.</p>
</section>
<section class="tex2jax_ignore mathjax_ignore" id="what-other-options-have-we-explored">
<h1>What other options have we explored?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-other-options-have-we-explored" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>We have investigated the following options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Remaining at NumFOCUS</p></li>
<li><p>Joining several other 501(c)(3) organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>Partnering with Linux Foundation via its 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(6)
support structures (our proposed path)</p></li>
<li><p>Creating our own 501(c)(3).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NumFocus, as previously stated, is not able to meet our needs and our
goals for Project Jupyter at this time.</p>
<p>Other 501(c)(3) organizations were either larger in scale, but without
deep experience supporting open source projects and their communities,
or smaller in scale but with experience supporting software projects.</p>
<p>The costs to instantiate and operate a new 501(c)(3) are very high and
the focus on building up back-office infrastructure expertise and
capabilities would limit our ability to focus on the needs stated
earlier.</p>
<p>After carefully evaluating all these options and engaging in multiple
detailed discussions, we concluded that the Linux Foundation is the best
option. LF can support our existing community and governance structure,
and it has a proven track record of supporting software projects with a
sustainable operational and multi-modal funding model that scales.</p>

<section class="tex2jax_ignore mathjax_ignore" id="how-does-this-affect-our-project-s-mission-regarding-both-open-science-education-and-access-to-all-regardless-of-money-or-industrial-relationships">
<h1>How does this affect our project’s mission regarding both open science, education, and access to all regardless of money or industrial relationships?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-this-affect-our-project-s-mission-regarding-both-open-science-education-and-access-to-all-regardless-of-money-or-industrial-relationships" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Project Jupyter’s mission and focus on open science remains unchanged
and driven by its contributors. Project Jupyter will develop a formal
mission statement that will reiterate our commitment to open science,
education, research and broad access to interactive computing. Based on
many previous discussions we’ve had on this topic, we propose here a
rough draft of such a mission statement: “Project Jupyter is an open and
collaborative community that develops interactive computing tools,
software, standards, and infrastructure for research, education, and
industry.” As part of the transition to LF, we will open an issue to
discuss and approve an official mission statement.</p>

<h2>What is the proposed timeline?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-proposed-timeline" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The EC anticipates community discussion in March 2024 leads to a formal
governance change proposal in April 2024 to move from NumFOCUS to LF
Charities 501(c)(3), creation of an LF 501(c)(6) foundation, and the
operational details of how these entities will be managed (e.g.,
creation of a budget process). The EC anticipates this proposal will be
voted on by the newly-elected EC and SSC by the end of April 2024. If
approved, the EC anticipates that the effective date of a move to LF
could be 60 days later, by the end of June 2024.</p>

<p>The Project Jupyter EC continues its current authority over funds and
grants that go to the 501(c)(3). As explained above, the corporate
funders to the Jupyter Foundation would have input, along with the
Project Jupyter EC, into how Jupyter Foundation funds are allocated for
the sustainability and growth of Project Jupyter.</p>

<p>Project trademarks, domain name registrations, and GitHub account access for
Project Jupyter GitHub organizations will be maintained by the 501(c)(3) LF
Charities. Additionally, any 501(c)(3) contributions to Project Jupyter will be
maintained by LF Charities and controlled by the Project Jupyter EC.</p>

<h2>How would this move to LF change our relationship with NumFOCUS?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-would-this-move-to-lf-change-our-relationship-with-numfocus" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Once the transition is concluded and assets (such as trademarks) are transferred, Project
Jupyter would not have a legal relationship with NumFOCUS. However, we
will always maintain a collaborative relationship with NumFOCUS and its
various projects: Jupyter is for many a portal into a broad ecosystem of
projects that currently operate under NumFOCUS, and we’ll continue
collaborating with all of them as before. In this regard, NumFOCUS is
and would remain a key partner for Project Jupyter, and we wish the
NumFOCUS team success.</p>
<p>We will work out a transition plan between NF and the LF Charities that
will minimize disruption to the projects. For exampe, there may be some funds that
are simpler to wind down through NF and some that are easier to move to
the LF Charities.</p>

<p>Jupyter’s current governance model requires any <a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter.org/governance/executive_council.html#shared-responsibilities-with-the-software-steering-council">changes to Jupyter’s governance</a>
to be approved by the Jupyter Executive Council and Software
Steering Council. Once these two bodies have voted to leave NumFOCUS and
transfer the project to LF Charities 501(c)(3), the NumFOCUS FSA
Committee will formally notify NumFOCUS of our plans. The current FSA
requires us to give NumFOCUS a 60-day notice before moving. The NumFOCUS
FSA Committee currently consists of Matthias Bussonnier, Benjamin
Ragan-Kelley, Fernando Pérez, Ana Ruvalcaba, and Thomas Kluyver.</p>

<p>When requested by the governing body for a project, the LF has moved
projects out of its stewardship to the governing body’s designated
entity. In our case, this would be considered a <a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter.org/governance/executive_council.html#shared-responsibilities-with-the-software-steering-council">governance change</a>
that requires approval from the EC and SSC. The Project Jupyter
assets in the 501(c)(3) would transfer to another 501(c)(3) and
501(c)(6) assets could be transferred to another 501(c)(6) or to the
501(c)(3), in accordance with tax rules and subject to grant agreements
then in effect. Similarly, there will be a notice period, and wind-down
component related to employees, IP, etc.</p>

<h2>What happens to our IP if LF Charities dissolves?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-happens-to-our-ip-if-lf-charities-dissolves" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Upon dissolution of any entity (LF Charities, NumFOCUS, etc), the entity would
have to either transfer assets or identify the entity taking them over.
Hypothetically, in a dissolution scenario, LF Charities would have to plan out
the path with the project governing body to see where the LF Charity project
assets would go. There may be complications or other factors depending on the
reason for any dissolution (e.g. bankruptcy). To be clear, there are no plans to
dissolve LF Charities.</p>

<h2>How does corporate membership work in terms of levels and dues amount?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-corporate-membership-work-in-terms-of-levels-and-dues-amount" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The details need to be finalized and we welcome input from the community
on this. Based on what is common with other funds under the Linux
Foundation 501(c)(6), typically there are 2 levels, Premier and General.
For example, Premier members each get a seat on the funding committee
and General members collectively have one elected representative from
the general member class that represents them alongside the Premier
members. The dues amount will be determined based on the financial needs
of Project Jupyter and corresponding alignment with corporate budgets
that have a precedent for supporting critical projects upon which
companies depend. The Linux Foundation also has (free) Associate
memberships for government, education, research, and non-profit
organizations. Given the importance of these types of organizations to
the mission of Jupyter, the EC would like to work through how they can
be included.</p>

<h2>Did we consider the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)?<a class="headerlink" href="#did-we-consider-the-apache-software-foundation-asf" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Yes. In our due diligence process, we considered several potential homes for
Jupyter. Specifically regarding ASF, moving to Apache would entail changing our
software license (to Apache), changing our project name to be <a class="reference external" href="https://projects.apache.org/projects.html">prefixed with
“Apache”</a>, and drastically changing
our project governance and communication channels. We saw these disruptions to
the community as too extreme compared to the benefits it would provide.</p>

<h2>Is this a major change to Project Jupyter’s governance?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-this-a-major-change-to-project-jupyters-governance" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>No. The control of the Project will remain with the same bodies (EC and SSC)
that have control under the umbrella of NumFocus when and if we move to the
Linux Foundation. There will be a new standing committee created to handle
corporate fundraising for the benefit of Project Jupyter. This committee will be
tasked with raising funds and budgeting the funds they raise in close
collaboration with the Project’s leadership (EC).</p>

<p>The decision-making authority of Project Jupyter is vested in the voting bodies
of our governance model. This does not change when we change fiscal sponsors.
The primary authority that we are granting to players with substantial financial
resources is to have a vote in how the funds they donate will be spent for the
benefit of Project Jupyter and the goals that are set by the EC and the SSC. To
ensure this, our agreement with the Linux Foundation will be to explicitly leave
intact our current governance model as it is.</p>

<h2>How will a transition to LF affect grant funding that community members may seek?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-will-a-transition-to-lf-affect-grant-funding-that-community-members-may-seek" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The EC believes that the Jupyter community needs a diverse set of funding
mechanisms to be sustainable and scale. In the past, grant funding that
benefited Jupyter has included academic grants managed directly by universities,
grants from private foundations that flowed through Jupyter’s 501(c)(3) fiscal
sponsor, and grants managed through other entities and foundations. We expect
that these sorts of funding arrangements will continue to be possible under the
LF umbrella, with community members able to seek grant funding themselves for
Jupyter’s benefit. We expect the central roles that we hire, such as an
executive director, program manager, etc., will be active in raising central
“backbone” funding for Jupyter and will help in the strategic coordination of
community members  seeking additional funding.</p>
<p>The Linux Foundation and LF Charities have both received and managed
grant-making programs. Under the LF umbrella, if you are writing a grant and
desire the grant funding to flow through the LF Charities Jupyter 501(c)(3)
account, we will have a process to approve the request. The LF staff would work
with you on the budget for the grant and any other details for the transaction,
but would rely on you for the grant writing and reporting requirements. Each
grant-making organization usually has terms and reporting requirements that the
LF and the grant recipients will need to work together on. The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-launches-tazama-for-real-time-fraud-management">Tazama
project</a>
is an example of a recent grant LF Charities is administering from the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/open-source-financial-inclusion-tazama">Bill and
Melinda Gates
Foundation</a>.</p>
