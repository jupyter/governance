# Standing Committees and Working Groups

## Overview

In addition to the software work on Jupyter that is coordinated through the [Software Steering Council](software_steering_council.md) (SSC), much of the project’s work expands beyond software. Examples include code of conduct incident response, diversity and inclusion, operations, legal, fundraising, events, community, and marketing. Standing Committees and Working Groups carry out this non-software related work of the project by delegation from the Executive Board (EB).

The primary difference between Standing Committees and Working Groups is that Standing Committees are  intended to be permanent; they are only created and dissolved by a joint vote of the EB and SSC. In contrast, Working Groups can be created and dissolved by the EB acting alone.

## Common Points

Standing Committees and Working Groups both:

- Have a well-defined membership who make decisions using the [Jupyter Decision-Making Guide](decision_making.md).
- Follow the membership appointment process outlined in their charter.
- Are managed by, report to, and are accountable to the Executive Board.
- Have charters that define their scope and purpose. Within those charters, they are free to make decisions autonomously.
- Carry out their functions in a manner that is as open and transparent as possible given the unique dimensions of their charter.
- Each Standing Committee and Working Group must have a public GitHub repository with basic information (members, charter, public meetings, SSC representative, etc.) for purposes of transparency and consistency.

## Standing Committees

Standing Committees have the following unique properties:

- Standing Committees focus on areas critical to the governance of the project and thus are established and dissolved by joint decisions of the SSC and EB.
- Changes to the charters of Standing Committees are approved by joint decisions of the SSC and EB.
- Standing Committees always have a representative on the SSC, elected by the Standing Committee membership.
- The EB is responsible for ensuring the Standing Committees are appropriately resourced at all times.

## Working Groups

Working Groups have the following unique properties:

- Working Groups are established and dissolved by decisions of EB.
- Changes to the charters of Working Groups are approved by the EB.
- Working Groups, by default, do not have representatives on the SSC.
- Optionally, the EB may nominate certain Working Groups to have a representative on the SSC. Once approved by the SSC to have a representative on the SSC, Working Groups elect and maintain their representative to the SSC using the Decision-Making Guide.
